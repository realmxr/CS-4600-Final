Final Pro ject Report due Dec 8  11:59 pm on Canvas 
In thi s project, you ar e going to design and (partiall y) impleme nt a s ecure communication system 
between t wo p arties .  
Requirements:  
The requirement s of the system include: 
1.) The tw
o parties have each other ’s RSA public key. Each of them holds his/her own RSA 
private key. 
2.) Each party ’s message ( from a .txt file) is encrypted using AES before sending it to 
another party. 
3.) The AES key  used in 2) is encrypted  using the receiver’ s RSA public key.  T he encrypted 
AES key is sent together with the encrypted message obtained from 2).  
4.) Message authentication code should be appended to data transmitted. You are free t o 
choose the specific protocol of MAC. 
5.) The receiver should be able to su ccessfully  authenticate, decrypt the message, and read 
the original message. 
You need t
o implement a program for each  role ( i.e., sender and receiver).  You don’t need to 
include actual socket programming in your code. You can just use local files as the channel to 
simulate the communication in the network. For example, t o implement requirement 1  above , we 
let each party locally generate a key pair and save each key in a corresponding file. The other party  will be able to know the public key by accessing the file. You can create a file called 
“Transmitted_Data”, which  can include all data transmitted between sender and receiver, i.e., 
encrypted message, encrypted AES key, and the MAC . This file is written by the sender and read 
by the receiver.  
Program
ming language and library 
You can choose either OpenSSL Crypto Library, J ava Cryptography Architecture or Python 
Crypto for your project. For Java based implementation, more helpful information can be found in the following links.  https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/security/java -security -overview1.html
